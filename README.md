# Salesforce_crm

In education and training organizations, a single student can enroll in multiple courses at the same time. Each enrollment goes through different stages such as Active, Dropped, On Hold, and Completed.

The challenge arises when administrators or counselors want to quickly understand how many active enrollments a student currently has. Without automation, this requires opening each enrollment record, checking the status, and manually counting them.

2. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

To solve this problem, an automated solution was designed using Salesforce Flow. The system automatically calculates the number of active enrollments for each student and updates this information directly on the student record.

The solution ensures:

Real-time updates

No manual intervention

High data accuracy

Scalable and maintainable automation
